# programming-language-recognition
A Feed Forward Neural Network that is able to recognize programming languages.

Introduction: 
This programming language recognition feed forward neural network was created in order to add functionality to the Web Assembly based Playground (WASP). It is incharge of recognizing the programming language that is typed into /predict/sample.txt. 

Current supported languages:
swift, go, kotlin, rust, c, cpp


When language support is added, follow the instructions in neuralnetwork.py and predict.py.

Future language support: 
swift, go, kotlin, rust, c, cpp, java, python, c#

The final version will be a node.js based project. Send an ajax call to the server and read the result. The network takes 6/10ms to execute per sentence.
